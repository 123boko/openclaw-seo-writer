# OpenClaw SEO Writer Agent ✍️

An advanced, SEO-optimized content creation agent built for the OpenClaw ecosystem. This agent is designed to produce high-quality, human-like articles that bypass AI detection while maintaining top-tier search engine performance.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. 🛡️ Anti-AI Detection (The "Human" Touch)
Designed using the principles in `SOUL.md` to avoid common AI footprints:
- **Burstiness**: Dramatic sentence length variation.
- **Perplexity**: Strategic use of unexpected word choices.
- **Banned Words**: Automatically blocks 30+ "AI-flavor" words (e.g., *delve, leverage, intricate*).
- **Imperfection**: Uses fragments and parentheticals to mimic human writing flow.

### 2. ⚡ 5-Phase Professional Workflow
The agent follows a structured process defined in `AGENTS.md`:
1. **Research**: Keyword intent and competitor analysis.
2. **Outline**: Logical structure with user approval checkpoints.
3. **Drafting**: Narrative-driven writing with high signal-to-noise ratio.
4. **Optimization**: Meta tags, links, and schema markup.
5. **Review**: Quality audit and readability checks.

### 3. 📈 SEO Optimization
Integrated skills in `skills/seo-writing/SKILL.md` ensure:
- Keyword density management (0.5-1.5%).
- Readability scores targeted between 60-70.
- Proper heading hierarchy (H1-H4).
- Internal and external linking strategy.
